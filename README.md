# Text Generation based on Critical Role scripts ðŸ“º

This language modeling project teaches a [Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)) network to continue sentences, by training it on a collection of transcripts of the live show [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/).

## The Dataset
Our dataset is comprised of all of the episode transcripts realised by the team over at [CRTranscript](https://crtranscript.tumblr.com/transcripts). It contains *180 files*, for a total of over *7 million words*, with a vocabulary of *52123 different tokens*.
 

## The Model
The Model uses a [PyTorch Transformer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Transformer.html), full with both its Encoder and Decoder sections. It also contains a positional encoding module, as well as an Embedder. All of those can be found in the `models.py` file.
